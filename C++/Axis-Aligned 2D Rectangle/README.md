# Axis-Aligned 2D Rectangle
Design and Implement a C++ program that implements the following:
• 2D Rectangle Class with floating point coordinates
	o Include methods for constructing an axis-aligned Rectangle with initial size and
coordinates
	o Include a Copy constructor and an Assignment operator
• Algorithm that checks whether or not a 2D point is contained in an axis-aligned Rectangle
• Algorithm that checks whether or not two axis-aligned Rectangles intersect
• Simple test code that creates instances of your class and tests your implementation
